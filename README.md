# Alternate approach of comparison for selection problem
A new algorithm for selection problem published in December 2016. Comparable with the best known algorithm for the problem with a completely different approach of comparison. Worst case- O(n^2), Best case- O(1), Average case- close to linear time ( theta(n) ).
